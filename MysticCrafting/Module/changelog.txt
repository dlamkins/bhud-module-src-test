#1.3 - Vendor & Currency changes
Vendors have been updated to display the required currencies and items underneath the vendor to make it easier to see the total cost (for example, the cost of acquiring the items to buy things from Lyhr). They are also grouped based on price and have an updated UI.
#Currency changes
Currencies are now displayed as nodes in the tree view and they function similarly to items. The number of currency you have is now also divided across the recipes.
#New version update window
A new window will be displayed after every new update with details about the latest changes. 
#Reduced RAM usage
The data storage was migrated to significantly reduce the overall RAM usage. Yay!
